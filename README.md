# linear-control-systems-project
This repository is dedicated to the development of a lead-lag controller for a given system, aiming to achieve specific desired characteristics. Originally, this project was created as the final project for the linear control systems course held in Fall 2022, conducted by Professor Soheil Ganjefar, Ph.D., at Iran University of Science and Technology.
The primary objective of this project is to design a lead-lag compensator utilizing the principles and boundaries of linear control system theory. The following steps were undertaken to accomplish this:

1. Root locus analysis: The root locus of the system was thoroughly examined to gain insights into the behavior and stability of the system.

2. Phase lead compensator design: Two commonly used approaches were employed to design a phase lead compensator, which effectively shapes the transient response of the system according to the desired characteristics.

3. Phase lag compensator incorporation: A phase lag compensator was introduced into the system to mitigate the steady-state error and ensure that it remains within the desired range.

4. System analysis with compensators: The system, equipped with the designed compensators, underwent comprehensive analysis to evaluate its performance and behavior. Based on this analysis, an alternative controller was developed, further refining the overall control strategy.

By following these steps, we aim to create an efficient lead-lag controller that fulfills the desired characteristics of the system. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the design, analysis, and development of such a controller, providing valuable insights and practical implementations.
